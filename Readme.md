# Project: Worker Data Management (Excel VBA-Based)

## Overview
This project consists of an Excel file with forms and VBA macro scripts, originally developed for a specific workplace in Hebrew. It is used to manage worker-related data such as:
- Personal details
- Qualifications
- Health approvals
- Lateness records
- Drill participation
- Performance reviews and exam results

### Important Notes
- **Development Context:** The project was created as a rolling project under time pressure and has been in daily use since then (currently 1.5 years).
- **"It works on my machine":** The solution was specifically written and tested for the environment itâ€™s currently being used in. Running it on other machines may require adjustments.
- **Mock Data:** The repository includes made-up data to protect privacy.

### Repository Contents
1. **Main XLSM File:** The core of the project, containing all forms and VBA logic.
2. **Supplementary Files:** Additional non-critical files, designed for use with a desktop shortcut to directly open specific forms in the main file.
3. **VBA Code Files:** These files allow you to view the VBA code without needing to open the XLSM. Hebrew text may appear as gibberish in these files, but it displays correctly in the main XLSM.

## Usage
If you intend to use or adapt this project, be aware that adjustments may be needed, especially for non-Hebrew systems or different machine environments.
